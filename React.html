                <br>
                Let’s go back to a life without Hooks. The main pain points focused on three things:
            <ul>
                <li>Giant and confusing components</li>
                <li>Reusing logic between components</li>
                <li>Confusing classes</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bold fs-4 mb-2">React Hooks</span>
                <br>
                Hooks are functions exposed by React that you can use from inside your functional components to access
                some of its features — like state for instances.
                Or, if you want to explain it on a one-liner: <br>
                Hooks lets you hook into React features from function. <br>
                So with Hooks, React now has a new stateful primitive that improves code reusability without changing
                the component hierarchy, by being able to create custom Hooks. Let’s split your components into smaller
                ones where the related logic is all coupled together, improving code readability, and use other React
                features without classes. All this without causing breaking changes!

                <span class="fw-bold fs-4">Conclusion</span>
                <br>
                With this article, we learned what motivated the appearance of Hooks and why they allow us to write
                React code the way it always supposed to be — reusable.
                Despite being around for a year by now, Hooks are nowhere as close to the expected potential. Many
                people still fear to learn Hooks and I hope this article gave you all some insights into them and you
                decide to give them a shot.
