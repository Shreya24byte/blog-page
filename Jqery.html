            <p class="mt-5 mb-3 ">jQuery is an open source, light weight, most popular JavaScript library that was
                developed for the sake of simplifying the interactions between an HTML or CSS document and JavaScript.
                In technical terms, it was for simplifying interactions between Document Object Model (DOM) and
                JavaScript.
                jQuery also helped in easing the usage of commonly performed JavaScript functionalities that had
                multiple lines of code into single line of code and also aided in performing AJAX calls in easier
                manner.</p>

                <span class="fw-bold fs-4 mb-2"> What are the advantages of jQuery?</span>
                <br>
                Most popular and open source
                Very fast and easily extensible
                Used to develop cross browser compatible web applications as jQuery works in almost the same manner for
                different kinds of browsers.
                Improves the performance of an application when using the minimised version of the jQuery library. The
                size of the minimized js file is almost 50% less than the normal js file. Reduction in the file size
                makes the web page load and work faster.
                Commonly implemented UI related functionalities are written using minimal lines of codes

                <span class="fw-bold fs-4 mb-2"> What is the difference between javascript and jquery?</span>
                <br>
                JavaScript is an interpreted language written in C and is combination of ECMAScript and DOM where jQuery
                is a JavaScript library developed to run things faster and make things simplified for JavaScript. jQuery
                doesnt have the ECMAScript.
                JavaScript requires long lines of code to code a functionality where in case of jQuery, just import the
                library and call the functions which would reduce the programmerâ€™s effort of coding.
                JavaScript doesnt have the cross browser compatible functionality which is why a developer has to write
                code manually to implement the functionality. Whereas the cross browser code compatibility is inbuilt in
                jQuery.

                <span class="fw-bold fs-4"> What are the selectors in jQuery? How many types of selectors in jQuery?
                </span>
                <br>
                In order to work with any element on the web page, we would first need to find it. Selectors find the
                HTML elements in jQuery. Some of the most commonly used and basic selectors are:
            <ul>
                <li>Name: Used to select all elements which matches the given element Name.</li>
                <li>#ID: Used to select a single element which matches with the given ID</li>
                <li>.Class: Used to select all elements which match with the given Class.</li>
                <li> Universal (*): Used to select all elements available in a DOM.</li>
                <li>Multiple Elements E, F, G: Used to selects the combined results of all the specified selectors E, F
                    or G.</li>
                <li> Attribute Selector: Used to select elements based on its attribute value.</li>
            </ul>
