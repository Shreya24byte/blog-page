                <br>
                JavaScript is programming language or specifically a scripting language which enables to create
                dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animated images and pretty much everything ðŸ˜ƒ
                <br>
                JavaScript is an interpreted language written in C and is combination of ECMAScript and DOM where jQuery
                is a JavaScript library developed to run things faster and make things simplified for JavaScript. jQuery
                doesnt have the ECMAScript.
                JavaScript requires long lines of code to code a functionality where in case of jQuery, just import the
                library and call the functions which would reduce the programmerâ€™s effort of coding.
                JavaScript doesnt have the cross browser compatible functionality which is why a developer has to write
                code manually to implement the functionality. Whereas the cross browser code compatibility is inbuilt in
                jQuery.

                <span class="fw-bold fs-4">JavaScript Data type & Structure</span>
                <br>
                There are ten types of data types in JavaScript. They are:
            <ol>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Integer</li>
                <li>Float</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Undefined</li>
                <li>Null</li>
                <li>Arrays</li>
                <li>Object</li>
                <li>Function</li>
                <li>BigInt</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

                <span class="fw-bold fs-4">Control Flow</span>
                <br>
                Probably the most basic topic on the list. One of the most important, maybe the most important one. If
                you do not know how to proceed with your code, you will have a hard time. Knowing the ins and outs of
                basic control flow is definitely a must.
            <ul>
                <li>if else â€” If you donâ€™t know these, how did you write code before?</li>
                <li>switch â€” is basically if else in a more eloquent way, use it as soon as you have multiple of
                    different cases. </li>
                <li>for â€” Do not repeat yourself, this is what loops are for. Besides the normalfor -loop `for of` and
                    for in come in very handy. The big advantage of for -loops is that they are blocking, so you can use
                    async await in them. </li>
                <li>Advanced conditionals â€” Using the ternary and logical operators can make your life a lot easier,
                    especially when you try to do things inline, meaning that you donâ€™t want to save values to use them
                    later.</li>
